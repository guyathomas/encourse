There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  > > Search engine for online courses

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  > > For people who know what they want out of an online course, but are unsure which platform will suit them best.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  > > This app will provide suggestions on what online course you should take based on what you expect to get out of the course and other factors such as workload. This will mean that people who have different desired outcomes can be directed straight to the single best course of action.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  > > The abundance of online learning opportunities has given anyone with the internet and a computer the ability to learn nearly anything that they want. The issue we now face is that with so many different platforms out there - deciding which course you will spend your precious spare time on is tough. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  > > This search engine will take in user preferences to provide a select handful of suggestions to a user on what course they should undertake. This will reduce the amount of time taken researching different platforms and potentially wasting time learning on the wrong platform.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  > > "Knowledge is power"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  > > All it takes to get started is to input what you want to learn and you will recieve top results. Any additional inputs will ensure that the suggestions are most tailored to your exact situation.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  > > I want to learn to code but I have no idea where to start.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  > > Given the impending issue that we face here, we will be taking immediate steps to understand our customers burning need. We will build a platform from the ground up that will help our customers learn what they want, without having to scavenge the internet for the correct place for them
